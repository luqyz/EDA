# EDA
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) is a crucial step in the data science workflow aimed at understanding the main characteristics of a dataset, often with visual methods. EDA helps to uncover patterns, spot anomalies, test hypotheses, and check assumptions before applying modeling techniques.

# Key Objectives:
Summarize the datasetâ€™s main features using statistical measures

Identify data quality issues such as missing values and outliers

Visualize data distributions and relationships between variables

Gain insights to guide feature engineering and model selection

# Common Techniques:
Descriptive statistics (mean, median, mode, variance)

Data visualization (histograms, box plots, scatter plots, correlation heatmaps)

Handling missing values and outliers

Checking data types and distributions

Tools and Libraries:
Pandas for data manipulation and summary statistics

Matplotlib and Seaborn for creating insightful visualizations
